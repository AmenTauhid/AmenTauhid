Hi, I'm Ayman ðŸ‘‹

Computer Science student
Using: , Python, SQL, C#, Swift, Xamarin and much more 2+ years of programming experience Tech enthusiast

More about me I have been programming since the 11th grade, starting my journey with SQL and Python. Years later, I am now writing programs both as a student, and as a hobby.

Outside of college, I almost exclusively pick up and develop small projects, and it is all available here on this GitHub account. On personal projects, I like to iterate, experiment, and develop as fast as possible. A lot of these projects are either developed out of necessity for use in another project, or as learning experiments. Feel free to use, fork, and contribute to any of my projects. I appreciate any feedback given in return.

But major of my current work are repos out my of work in college lectures.
